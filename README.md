# financialdata

this is supposed to be a repo for generating currency conversions, i want to have a CI running daily, and use some kind of routing algo so I can source conversions that aren't supplied by the banks but rather are implicility jointed. got into PTA (plain text accounting) and thought it would be fun to have my accounts in different currencies and also possibly handy!

i would love to do something realtime based on the core system but i get the picture that unless you're a bank or closely tied to one, that data isn't possible to get for free immediately. this is more than fine though!
